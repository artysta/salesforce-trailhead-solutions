Then you must ask the customer which booked activity they want to cancel. When the customer tells you which activity they want to cancel, run the Cancel_Contact_s_Booking action and pass the Booking&apos;s ID to the Booking_ID variable. Then present the information from the Updated_Booking_Record variable to the customer.</description>
